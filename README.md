# NodeMCU-Deauther-project
A NodeMCU based deauther to test Wi-Fi networks and find vulnerabilities. I only used it to test my personal home Wi-Fi and I am not planning to use it in any other way.

For my first project using ESP8266. I loaded ESP-8266 Deauther firmware on it using the official guide. I wanted to make it usable without Micro-USB, so I used 18650 battery which I had lying in my house

### In this project I used:
- 1x NodeMCU LoLin Micro-USB (which I found in my brother's room)
- 2x 80x60mm Breadboards
- 1x OLED Display 0.96" I2C 128x64 (Blue)
- 1x MT3608 DC-DC Boost 2A
- 1x TP4056 Type-C with protection
- 1x 18650 holder
- 1x 18650 battery
- 11x Male-to-male Dupont cables 5cm (a little bit smaller is better because it becomes messy)
- 2x Male-to-female Dupont cables 10cm
- 3x 6x6x5mm Tactile Push Button Switch
- 1x 9х9х5mm heatsink for TP4056 (because it can get very hot)
- A little bit of double sided tape but it can be replaced by using some glue

I connected two breadboards to make larger workspace and added bottle caps as a stand to raise it, they are detachable because I taped them using double sided tape. Also i added a bit of foam on pins to not bend them accidentally.
